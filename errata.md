# Errata for *Essential TypeScript 4*

**Chapter 10**

The example in **Listing 10-22** doesn't produce the expected results because, as the chapter notes, there is no intersection between the `number` and `string` types. Please ignore the results from this listing.

(Thanks to Bersez Nathan - aka GazousGit - for reporting this issue)
